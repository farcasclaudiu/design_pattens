    /// This transformation lets you pass requests 
    /// as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, 
    /// and support undoable operations.
    /// 
    /// Use when:
    /// - you want to parametrize objects with operations.
    /// - you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, 
    ///     or execute them remotely. (serialize commands)
    /// - you want to implement reversible operations.
